# Cookiecutter template for Data Analytics

_A flexible project structure for doing and sharing Data Analytics work._

## Requirements

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
- [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html): This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Create a new project

In a folder where you want your project generated:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/jvelezmagic/cookiecutter-conda-data-science
```

## Resulting directory structure

    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
    ├── install.md         <- Detailed instructions to set up this project.
    ├── data
    ├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
    │                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
    │                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
    │
    ├── reports            <- Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
    ├── environment.yml    <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment.
    └── setup.py           <- Makes project pip installable (pip install -e .)
                              so {{ cookiecutter.project_module_name }} can be imported.
